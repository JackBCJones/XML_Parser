Currently this app is running on React with Vite and Tailwind for the frontend and flask as the backend. 

This project will only be able to convert xml files to JSON and convert the positions of the x and y values to fit a 
specific field (AC MILAN)

going forward, this project will work towards doing the rest of the conversions such as adding the rarity and then the scores. 
there should be inputs for the size of the field to convert the values to and for the different score combinations. 

Eventually, this project will be hosted on AWS and will make use of their cloud services.
